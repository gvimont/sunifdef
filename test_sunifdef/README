Testing Sunidef
===============

By running `make check' or `make test_sunifdef' in this directory you can
build the program test_sunifdef.

You can use test_sunifdef to supply a test case to sunifdef and compare the
output with what you expect.

Run `test_sunifdef --help' to see the usage of test_sunifdef.

The subdirectory test_cases contains test cases represented by pairs of files:
testNNNN.c (the test file) and testNNNN.c.expect (the expected output file)

The script test_set_1.sh will run test_sunifdef for all the test cases in the
test_cases directory. Run `test_set_1.sh -h' to see the usage of the script.

The script collate_tests.sh will collate all the test cases into a single file,
sunifdef_test_cases.c, for easier inspection. Each test file testNNNN.c is
listed followed by the expected file testNNNN.c.expect.
