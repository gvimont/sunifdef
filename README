Installng
=========

See the file INSTALL for installation guidance.

Note that you must be root to run `make install'.

A successful installation in the default path (/usr/local) will create 2 files:

- The sunifdef executable /usr/local/bin/sunifdef
- The sunifdef man page /usr/local/man/man1/sunifdef.1

You can execute `sunifdef --version' at the command prompt to test that sunifdef
is correctly installed, and you can execute `man sunifdef' to test that the man
page is correctly installed.


HTML Documentation
==================
If you are running a version of KDE Konqueror that supports the man:/ protocol
then you can view the man page in HTML by entering man:/sunifdef in the address
bar.

Otherwise you can use the HTML version of the man page that is included in the
distribution: sunifdef/man/html/sunifdef_man_1.html.

If Doxygen is installed on your system then Maintainer's documentation can be
generated by running `make doxygen' in the package directory.

Security

Testing Sunifdef
================
There is a test suite in /sunifdef/test_sunifdef. The test suite is executed by
`make check'. There is more information in /sunifdef/test_sunifdef/README
